				The story of Tatva begins with the British Empire, unfortunately, as is often the case in
				modern Indian history. In the 1600s, the British, in their relentless pursuit of global
				expansion, developed a deep fondness for Chinese tea. So much so, in fact, that they soon
				found themselves in a trade deficit. Determined to balance the scales, they turned their
				attention to Assam, seizing its fertile lands to cultivate the tea they had come to revere.
				After a failed attempt to steal China‚Äôs secrets, however, the British discovered that their
				newly sourced tea tasted dreadful. And to make matters worse, the people of England weren‚Äôt
				interested in drinking it. True to their imperial nature, the British launched a 40-year
				campaign to force this tea onto the Indian population.
				<br /><br />
				The tea, still lacking flavor, eventually found its way into the hands of India‚Äôs street vendors.
				Somewhere between World War I and the 1930s, these chaiwallahs began adding spices, transforming
				the once-bland brew into something extraordinary. And so, masala chai was born. Today, it remains
				one of India's most cherished traditions: every morning, my parents begin their day with a cup
				of masala chai, just as nearly every household across India does. Chai is woven into the fabric
				of our daily lives and is an integral part of the history of free India, and it was brewed in
				resistance.
				<br /><br />
				I never really paused to consider the history behind chai in my culture. I simply assumed it
				had always been there. But it made me wonder how many other foods, flavors, and ingredients do
				I take for granted? For example, truffles in Italian cuisine, Sichuan peppercorns in Chinese
				food, Aleppo peppers in Syrian dishes, and za'atar in Mediterranean cooking. These ingredients
				feel so tied to their cultures, as if they‚Äôve always belonged. But each one has its own journey
				of how it originated, how it traveled, and how it came to find a home in new lands. And that‚Äôs
				the essence of Tatva.
