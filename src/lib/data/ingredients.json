			"A greyish-yellow spice with a sharp, sulphurous odor, asafoetida takes its name from a blend of Farsi and Latin, literally meaning “stinking resin.” The name doesn’t get any gentler in other tongues either. English, Turkish, and French offer equally vivid translations: Devil’s Dung, Şeytan Tersi, and Merde du Diable. And yet, despite (or perhaps because of) its overpowering aroma, asafoetida, hing in Hindi, has become an essential ingredient in the Indian kitchen.",
			"To understand asafoetida’s curious place in culinary history, we must first look to silphium, a prized plant in ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. In 631 BCE, when the Greeks colonized the city of Cyrene (present-day Libya), they encountered this extraordinary herb and quickly fell under its spell. Silphium became so valuable, it was used as a vegetable, seasoning, animal feed, and medicine. It even appeared on Cyrenian currency. But despite strict efforts to conserve it, overharvesting eventually led to its disappearance.",
			"Now imagine the scene centuries later, in 328 B.C., as Alexander the Great's army marched through the wild landscapes of Afghanistan. There, his soldiers stumbled upon a plant that looked and smelled remarkably like their long-lost silphium. They believed they had found their beloved herb again, but in fact, it was a pungent resin-producing plant we now know as asafoetida.",
			"Although historical records are hazy, it is widely believed that Alexander, mistaking asafoetida for silphium, brought the plant along on his expedition to India. While he may have returned in defeat, asafoetida remained, eventually embedding itself in the culinary and medicinal traditions of the subcontinent. In fact, it’s possible that asafoetida made its way to India even earlier. References to meat dishes spiced with hing appear in the Mahabharata, the ancient Indian epic that recounts events from around 800 BCE, predating the more commonly cited, Euro-centric story of silphium’s disappearance."
